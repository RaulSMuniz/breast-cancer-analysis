## Project Overview

This project focuses on early detection of breast cancer using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to build a supervised learning model for tumor classification. A secondary goal is to apply unsupervised clustering algorithms for descriptive segmentation and pattern discovery.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The exploratory analysis aims to better understand the dataset and key variables. Highlights include:

- Distribution of tumor types: **benign** vs. **malignant**.
- Analysis of critical features such as **mean/worst area**, **perimeter**, and **radius**.
- Identification of correlations and patterns that effectively distinguish between tumor types.

## Predictive Modeling

Two machine learning models were used for binary classification:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **XGBoost**

Steps involved:

- Model training and validation.
- Hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluation using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
- Analysis of **confusion matrices** to assess model performance in detail.

**Note:** Special attention was given to **recall**, due to its importance in correctly identifying malignant tumors and minimizing false negatives.

## Descriptive Analysis

To identify hidden patterns and groupings, the project applies:

- **K-Means Clustering** to segment data based on feature similarity.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and visual exploration of clusters in 2D space.

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout this project, I developed and strengthened the following skills:

- End-to-end understanding of the **machine learning project lifecycle**.
- Competence in **exploratory data analysis**, including pattern detection and handling class imbalance.
- Ability to **compare and optimize predictive models** using business-relevant metrics.
- Practical experience with **unsupervised learning techniques** such as clustering and PCA for visualization and interpretation.

## Next Steps

Moving forward, I plan to:

- Explore **data visualization tools** like Power BI.
- Study **Deep Learning techniques**, including CNNs and neural network architectures.
- Learn how to **deploy machine learning models** for real-world usage.
- Dive deeper into **advanced ML frameworks** such as **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**.
